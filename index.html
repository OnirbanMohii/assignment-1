            Technology plays a huge role in our daily lives, from the simplest of apps to the most groundbreaking
            inventions. Every website or piece of software that we encounter has been built by a web developer—but what
            exactly is web development, and what do they do? All of this will be answered in this guide to how to become
            a web developer.

                “Missions is not the ultimate goal of the church. Worship is. Missions exists because worship doesn't.”

                “It doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down. All that matters is you get up one more time
                than you were knocked down.” ― Roy T. Bennett

            <p>
                "The trouble with not having a goal is that you can spend your life running up and down the field and
                never score." –Bill Copeland

            No one can become perfect in just one day. Only Practice makes a man perfect. But now the phrase is changed;
            only perfect practice makes the difference. You must strive for progress and not perfection. Progress
            happens with more and more practice. You need a lot of practice to master something.
